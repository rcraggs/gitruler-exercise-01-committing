## Changing files and committing those changes.

1. Use a [text editor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_editor) to add `Manfred Delmonte` to a new line in `files/employees.txt` and `Peaches` to a new line in `files/products.txt`.
1. Discover which files need to be committed. Stage the changes that you made to the files.
1. Commit your staged changes using the commit message "Add Manfred and Peaches". 
1. Check that all of your changes are committed.

If you have your own repository containing this exercise (e.g. a fork) then you can push the changes you made.

## Resources

1. For many of the steps you could use the [Git cheat sheet](https://services.github.com/on-demand/downloads/github-git-cheat-sheet.pdf) or [git - the simple guide](http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/) to find the correct command.
1. For setting up your git configuration you can see the "Your Identity" and "Your Editor" sections of the [Git Pro Book](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-First-Time-Git-Setup).

For staging and committing modifications to already tracked files take a look at "Staging Modified Files" and "Committing Your Changes" in [Git Pro Book](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Recording-Changes-to-the-Repository). These sections will also explain how to provide commit messages.
